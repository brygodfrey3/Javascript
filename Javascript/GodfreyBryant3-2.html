<h1> The Life Story of Bryant Godfrey (Condensed Version) </h1>
<p> Light, white snowflakes gently flutter to the ground. People of all shapes and sizes bustle to the large, brick building marked "hospital". The weather is cold, causing everyone to scurry faster than usual. It was under these traditional circumstances on December 16, 1988 that Bryant Godfrey came into this world. </p>

<p> As a young boy, Bryant took pleasure in the things children typically do. T-ball, school science projects, and playing with his black-lab, Houdini. Bryant learned the value of hard-work even as a young child. He would ride with his father for long hours on a green, John-Deere 4440 tractor. Helping remove rocks from fields that needed to planted was something he did not enjoy, but later grew to appreciate. Before he was even 16, Bryant was taught to drive a tractor and truck so he could help his father. </p>

<p> As the young man began to learn and grow it was necessary for him to attend school. Kindergarten was enjoyable due to the naps and Teddy Gram cookies. Middle school taught him basic arithmetic and a love for reading. In fact, students were required to take tests to verify they had read their books. Bryant was informed, through these tests, that he had a college-level reading ability at the age of thirteen. High-school was attended at Sky-View High in Smithfield, Utah. Bryant found the lessons boring and dull. He enjoyed the social aspect of school much more than studying, but still managed to graduate and walk with his class. </p>

<p> After graduation Bryant obtained employment with JM Mechanical in Hyde Park, Utah. His job was to build and install heating and air-conditioning parts. The work was difficult, the hours were long, but many important lessons were learned. While employed at JM, Bryant completed the necessary paperwork to go on a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Bryant received a call to Chile, Concepcion and left shortly thereafter. </p>

<p> The lessons and experience gained during Bryant's time as a missionary could fill many books and volumes if written down completely. For our purposes it is necessary to know only three things. He thought he would never learn Spanish and now speaks it fluently, he survived the 6th largest earthquake ever recorded, and he is influenced every day of his life by his choice to serve. </p>

<p> Upon returning from his mission, Bryant began his college studies at Utah State University. He studied there for a year before meeting his now wife, Vanessa. Vanessa was, and still is, a student of BYU Idaho, and that is what caused Bryant to transfer his studies. Bryant and Vanessa are happily married, have two dogs, and recently bought their first home in Ucon, Idaho. </p>

<p> The final paragraph of any story is usually the end. Everything wraps up, and conclusions are made. It is necessary to think of this story as a part-one in an ongoing saga. Only the future will tell what adventures Bryant and Vanessa will have; just know they are thrilled to be along for the ride. </p>
